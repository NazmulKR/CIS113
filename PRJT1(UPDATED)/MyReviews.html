			<h2>My Personal Review</h2>
			<p>The <strong>Harry Potter</strong> series is more than just a collection of movies; it is a story that has captured the hearts of millions. Watching Harry's journey from a young boy discovering magic to the hero who defeats Voldemort is an unforgettable experience. The series is filled with brilliant storytelling, deep character development, and magical world-building that make it timeless. My personal favorite moment is when <strong>Snape's true loyalty is revealed</strong>, showing that his love for Lily Potter guided his every action.</p>

					<li><strong>Dumbledore is Dead:</strong> This theory suggests that Dumbledore represents Death from <b>The Tale of the Three Brothers</b>, as he gives Harry the Invisibility Cloak, possesses the Elder Wand, and guides him in the afterlife.</li>
					<li><strong>Neville as the Chosen One:</strong> The prophecy could have applied to either Harry or Neville, meaning that Neville could have been the one destined to defeat Voldemort.</li>
					<li><strong>Crookshanks' Secret Identity:</strong> Some fans believe that Hermione's cat, Crookshanks, was once the Potter family's pet, as he instantly recognizes Scabbers (Pettigrew) as an untrustworthy animagus.</li>
